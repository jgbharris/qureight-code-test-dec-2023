# Qureight code test

To get this working locally please clone the repo and run `npm i` or `npm install` in the parent folder.

To get the server working please navigate to the server folder in the project, run `npm install` and then run `node app.js`

You will also need to change the file path in `server/app.js` at line 18 to the file path on your local machine.

## Details and approach

This is a basic React app with image upload functionality.

I used styled components for styling rather than a UI library.
